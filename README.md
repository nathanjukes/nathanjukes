## About Me

I'm a UK Based undergrad studying Computer Science ðŸ“š. I am currently focused on .NET and am trying to branch off into becoming a .NET Core and ASP.NET developer ðŸŽ¯


## Some of my Repos

- ### **Sorting Algorithm Visualiser** - [Link](https://github.com/nathanjukes/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualisation-Tool)
  This allowed me to learn a wider range of sorting algorithms whilst also being able to understand them more conceptually due to the visualisation of it.

- ### **Github Clone(r)** - [Link](https://github.com/nathanjukes/Git-Clone-r-)
  I created this Github Clone(r) to assist myself with backing up and mass-downloading my repos, I added more features later to make it more appealing and helpful to the majority.
